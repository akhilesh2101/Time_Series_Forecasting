# Time_Series_Forecasting

In this Project, I made a forecast model of the Quarterly US housing prices using the data picked up from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/Federal Reserve Economic Data . The data is published as a single line chart showing the trend of housing since 1963 and no prior data is included.

Data-set has only 2 columns, Date column along with the quarterly average US housing prices.

Leveraged both ARIMA and PROPHET modeling for forecasting
